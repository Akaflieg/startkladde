In date inputs, we use a non-default, translatable format specification because
the default specification uses a two-digit date format (at least for some
locales). The inputs use padded fields to avoid ambiguity with keyboard entry
(e. g. 11/1/xxxx vs. 1/11/xxxx).

Dialogs with table and tree views will typically call the respective
resizeColumnsToWidth methods on language change.

For designer-created ui windows/widgets, text that will be set programmitically
should
* be set to a dummy text, approximating the actual text, in [brackets]
* be set to non-translatable, because on retranslation, it is usually better to
  leave the text in the original language than to overwrite it with the dummy
  text
