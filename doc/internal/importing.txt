Notes:
  - Club IDs and person names are case insensitive

Reasons for using ID/ID_old rather than ID/ID_new:
  - With ID/ID_new it would be impossible to distinguish between
    removing an ID and not changing it.
  - The idea is that the data supplied is the *current* data.
  - Adding an ID to a person (probably confirming a newly created person) is
    the same as adding a new person, from the view of the club admin.

Test cases:
  - Adding a person which is entirely new (with/without club_id)
  - Adding (confirming) a person which has been entered into the
    editable table
  - Comfirming a person which has been imported (persons which haven't
    changed)
  - Changing the club_id (change/add/remove)
  - Changing the name (only possible with club_id)
  - Removing a person
