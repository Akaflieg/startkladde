/*
 * Architecture rationale:
 *
 * We can't simply put the back-end class (e. g. QIODevice implementation) on
 * a background thread, because:
 *   - setup/open is not thread safe
 *   - open isn't a slot (setup neither)
 *
 * It may not be allowed to access the back-end in a thread other than where it
 * was created. Therefore, the whole DataStream must live on a background thread
 * where it creates, opens and accesses the back-end. It must therefore be
 * thread safe.
 *
 * Potential improvements:
 *   - Less code in background thread: only have back-end on background thread,
 *     not the state tracking
 *   - We can't call streamParametersCurrent() from the GUI thread as it
 *     accesses the back-end.
 *   - We shouldn't abuse the connectionBecameAvailable mechanism for
 *     reconnecting on settings change when in error state
