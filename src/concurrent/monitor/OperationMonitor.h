/**
 * A class that allows monitoring and canceling an operation, typically running
 * in a different task
 *
 * An operation has:
 *   - a status: a string
 *   - a progress: a progress value and a maxProgress value; progress==
 *     maxProgress==0 means "no progress information" - GUIs may display a
 *     "busy" indicator in this case
 *
 * The operation accesses the task through its OperationMonitorInterface.
 *
 * How to use:
 *   asyncOperation (Returner<T> *returner, OperationMonitor *monitor)
 *   {
 * 		returnOrException (returner, actualOperation (monitor->interface ()));
 *   }
 * The interface is passed by copy. After the last copy (except the master copy
 * in the monitor) is destroyed, the end of the operation is signaled to the
 * monitor, as if interface.ended () had been called.
 *
 * When using with an operation that does not take an OperationMonitorInterface,
 * it still has to be fetched and destroyed at the correct time to signal the
 * end of the operation:
 *   asyncOperation (Returner<T> *returner, OperationMonitor *monitor)
 *   {
 * 		OperationMonitorInterface interface=monitor->interface ();
 * 		returnOrException (returner, actualOperation);
 *   }
 * See, for example, ThreadSafeInterface::asyncOpen.
 *
 * Note that the query methods of DefaultInterface can be canceled by an own
 * mechanism and will throw an OperationCanceledException directly. Using said
 * mechanism is less convenient, but necessary because the connection has to be
 * kicked (using TcpProxy). Thus, the monitor is only necessary for status and
 * progress reporting.
 *
 * This class is thread safe.
